# ðŸŽµ MyPlaylists

#### MyPlaylists is a 1-to-1 fully functional clone of Apple's Apple Music app that I've built using UIKit & SwiftUI. I've built it for learning purposes and have mainly focused on the app's responsiveness since I already have plenty of projects that focus more on the architectural side.
#### Follow my tutorial where I explain step-by-step how to implement this project [HERE](https://medium.com/@aisultan.askarov/lets-build-an-apple-music-app-and-integrate-apple-music-in-your-app-part-1-getting-access-to-b01382b68537)

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies:

* SwiftUI
* UIKit
* Unit Testing
* MVVM & MVC
* Music Kit
* Networking 

## ðŸš¦ Running the Project

To run the project on your device, follow these steps:

* You will need a device and an Apple Music subscription.
* This project doesn't use any third-party libraries, so just build it and it will work.
