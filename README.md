# MyPlaylists
 
UIKit + SwiftUI App.

The MyPlaylists project is an exemplar of my expertise in developing fully functional applications from initial designs or minimal viable products. It replicates the 1 to 1 features of the Apple Music app. I employed the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to monitor modifications in the current track of playlists throughout the application. Moreover, a customized miniature player was created that mirrors the expand and shrink functionality of Apple Music. Additionally, I incorporated custom ContextMenus to enable the use of pop-up menus extensively employed in the Apple Music app, along with custom tap and swipe gestures.

Tech used:

Swift | SwiftUI | UIKit | File Manager | Cache Data | Unit Testing | MVVM | MVC | Music Kit | MediaKit | AVPlayer | StoreKit | JSON | URLSession | Encoding | Decoding | SKCloudServiceController | MPMusicPlayerController | UIView\UIViewController Representables
